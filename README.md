# SharedSPICE (Ngspice.dll) C# Interface
Simple script to provide interface between SharedSPICE (Ngspice.dll) and C#

# Disclaimers
This script was created for use within the Unity Game Engine, and as such, I haven't tested this anywhere else. So using it in a C# project in Visual Studio, for example, may require some slight tweaks. This sample script has also not been compiled, so some minor errors may be present.
